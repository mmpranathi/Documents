Install node.js
Install angular cli
Install types script 



Angular is javascript binding framework which binds HTML UI and Javascript model, it helps to reduce lengthy code 
It helps build SPA by using concept of routing

Diff Angular JS and Angular?

Angular JS	Angular
JS 	TS
Controller 	Component 
No	Mobile Compliant
No	CLI
No	Lazy loading
No	Server side

Directives are angular syntaxes helps to attach behavior of DOM
Types of directives
Structural - change the structure of the DOM element Ex: ngFor
Attribute - changes the behavior  depending on the result Ex: hidden, color change
Component - user control , own template Ex: @Component

What is npm and use of node_modules
NPM: Node package manager, installs packages and stores in node_modules

Package.json, references of library

Typescript, superset of javascript. Adds types to javascript
It supports OOPS concepts, can write classes, interfaces
Converts to javascript at the time of compilation

Angular CLI, command line interface
CLI, can create projects , componets

Components - writes binding code 
Modules - logically groups components

Importance of decorator - defines what kind of angular class it is.
@Componet for Component
@ngModule for Modules

Annotations and metadata  - > same as decorator

Template - html view of angular 

Types of data binding in angular - expression or interpolation {{}}
Property binding - component to view
Event binding - click (), from view to component 
Two way binding - component to view and view to component

Angular architecture - 
Template - nothing but view
Component - view talks to component 
Modules - group of components 
Bindings - 
Directives 
Services - common logic 
Dependency injection - 

What is SPA
Single page application:  load the UI once and don't reload again and again
	Performance improvement
To implement SPA, we use routing

Routing, to define the navigation of the application

Lazy loading: ondemand loading, loads only necessary files
Divide project into separate modules, and use loadChildren

What are services, shares common logic across angular projects

Dependency injection - rather than creating instantiating from class itself ,
Inject the service through constructor 

Register the services in Providers, app.modules.ts
decoupled,

Difference ngserve - builds application in memory
 and ng build  builds on harddisk-is for production
Ngbuild --prod filag, make the application ready for production. Removes unnecessary files and minifies the code.
